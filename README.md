# rover

## Purpose 

This is a simple command line utility that allows for the quick retrieval of datasets.
The datasets are defined in a `roverfile` in the user's config directory. 
This allows for the custom definitions of commonly required datasets.

I don't believe that this will be particularly useful to anyone other than myself.
However, this serves two purposes

1. Implements this desired functionality that I need
2. Let's me work with rust
